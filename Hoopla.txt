LICENSE

Look at JUCE --
* no guarantee that reported bugs will be fixed
* etc.
* even if you paid



SUPPORT / FAQ
* we don't want to be on the hook for Windows dev/support since it is so finicky and inconsistent (maybe we could eventually use Cocotron though?)
* Use the forum -- oops, this means we need a forum...  What about FogBugz?
